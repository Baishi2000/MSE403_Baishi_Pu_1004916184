## This is a repo of my Materials Data Analysis course projects. 
- each assignment focuses on a different step / tool of data analysis, mostly in a materials science setting.
  - **Assi 2**: read and extracting high-level summary from excel to dataframe; data cleaning, feature correlation analysis and feature selection.
  - **Assi 3**: slicing strings to normalize chemical formulas, import online datasets and and perform cleaning.
  - **Assi 4**: unsupervised learning (clustering) to map alloy mixtures onto phase diagrams, using raw diffraction data & featurizers.
  - **Assi 5**: building linear regression models to predict glass formability, reporting training and validation errors by parity plots.
  - **Assi 6**: using classification (LDA) to predict alloy mixtures' glass formability & quantify prediction confidence.
  - **Assi 7**: using regularized linear models (LASSO) trained on partial diffraction data to predict the FWHM over the entire quanternary space.
  - **Assi 8**: building decision tree & random forest classifiers, tuned hyperparameters by minimizing ROC AUC during gridsearch-CV. Visualized feature importance by plotting decision tree and calculating each feature's gini index.
  - **Final**:
    Part I: building a LASSO tuned and trained on partially corrupt experimental data to output the correct data set.
    Part II: Building an active learning algorithm which employs a customized acquisition policy that can be tuned to behave like 1. random sampling 2. sample by exploitation 3. sample by upper confidence bound
